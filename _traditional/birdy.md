This is a monotype print. A monotype is a one-off print where you paint directly on the print bed and pull the image from that. The mono comes from the fact that there is only one print produced in this method.

This print was an experiment in drawing the same image over and over to create a [petimento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentimento) leaving impretions of the process of creation; ghosts if you will. The focal point of the eye is modled after a cow's, lending a connection of my past work on the farm. The smoke emanating from the mouth and head are there to evoke the connection for the mind and word. While the sparks are perecent powder sprinkled into the wet ink before the pull meant to be a starfield and the vastness of the universe.
