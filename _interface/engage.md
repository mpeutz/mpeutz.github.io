 Engage is an online design tool that allows for online creation and subsequent embedding of electronic schematics. Along with the schematics there are three other modules, Build of materials list, clickable banner and 3D parts viewer. This application was designed to be a self-service SaaS platform for electronic companies to showcase their parts within their own site.

The Engage dashboard is where a user would create, group, and manage their modules. This card interface was chosen so a preview iamge could be displayed for each module, making it easier to see them at a glance.

Creating or opening an existing module would put the user in edit mode. Here they could create a schematic, banner, upload 3D model, or  Bill of Materials. This is where they could copy the embed code so they could impant then module into their site.

The 3D view module was a key feature in the application. This was designed as a quick and easy way for users to get 3d Models into their site.

Along with embeding modules within their sites users would get analytics on each one. The page  was designed to give this information to the user in a visual way.
