Jarvis (later changed to EasyDesign) was a SaaS application designed to be an all-in-one electronic schematic solution. With the application user could create share and edit schematics. It was a simple tool released in the asian market. Unfortunately it was taken down shortly after its release due to a change in marketing for this market.

Hero banner used to welcome potential users to the site.

  <figcaption class="mp-post-caption">Schematic gallery.</figcaption>
</figure>

The gallery was set up using a card and grid interface. On each card was a preview of the schematic, the creator, a description, and various bits of meta data. There could also be larger "sponsored" cards.

  <figcaption class="mp-post-caption">List view of schematics.</figcaption>
</figure>

User could change from the card view to a list. This would give the same information but in a denser format.

  <figcaption class="mp-post-caption">Schematic details view.</figcaption>
</figure>

On the details page you could take any number of actions on the schematic including forking, sharing, and liking just to name a few.

  <figcaption class="mp-post-caption">Schematic edit mode.</figcaption>

Users could edit schematics directly in the page and export to easyPCB to get back physical products.
