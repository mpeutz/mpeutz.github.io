<p>If you need to go to the bathroom after this next series of tests, please let a test associate know, because in all likelihood, whatever comes out of you is going to be <a href="#">coal</a>. Only temporary, so do not worry. If it persists for a week, though, start worrying and come see us, because that's not supposed to happen.</p>

<p>All right. We're working on a little teleportation experiment. Now, this doesn't work with all skin types, so try to remember which skin is yours, and if it doesn't teleport along with you, we'll do what we can to sew you right back into it.</p>
