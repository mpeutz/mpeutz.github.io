One of the first images I made using Aviary.com's pattern generator Peacock. This early version of the software had limited canvas size so the image has a low quality look to it. This image really showed me what the application was capable of.

The English name, dandelion, is a corruption of the French dent de lion meaning "lion's tooth", referring to its coarsely toothed leaves.
